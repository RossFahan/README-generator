## Description 

This is a simple README generator that generates the markdown for a README file for a user based on their input to a series of questions. The user is prompted through the command line to provide data regarding the title their project, project description, installation instructions, usage, license, contributions, test information, and contact information. 

The application will generate the README.md file using markdown and will also include a badge for the chosen license as well as a link to the license text.

## Learning Points
